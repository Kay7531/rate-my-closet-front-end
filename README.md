*Rate My Closet* is a platform that provides users the answer to the age-old question “How do I look?”. As a user you can log in and upload a photo of their outfit. Users are able to create, edit, and delete their outfit posts. You are also able to view other people outfit posts in the main feed. The comment and rating feature are still under construction, but once complete, a user will be able to comment and rate other people’s outfits.
